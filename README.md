# Duncan Yu

I build experimental AI systems and explore how intelligent models become real, usable software.

My work sits between research prototypes and operational systems — combining LLMs, automation pipelines, and modular architectures to understand how intelligent software can move from idea → experiment → reliable tool.

## What I'm Exploring

Most of my projects revolve around a single question:

> How do we turn powerful models into dependable systems?

This has led me toward work in:

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- LLM orchestration & agent design
- voice and multimodal interaction systems
- automation pipelines
- early DevOps and infrastructure thinking

Rather than isolated projects, I treat repositories as experiments in system design.
